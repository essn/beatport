        With the old specialists like Mike Oldfield and Jean Michel Jarre always on
        my mind, my main interest lies in electronic music. I always liked the the
        80''s where the synthie pop scene was invented, and it was also my very first
        time on the dance floor. At the end of the 80''s, I believe it was in ''86,
        a track called \"Electric Salsa\" from the artist Sven V\u00c3\u00a4th (the
        band name was \"OFF\") came out. In the year ''92 he founded the label EYE-Q
        Records which produced music with a sound that influenced me and got me in
        to the tekkno scene.  In the year 1995 i started to make electronic music
        along with a friend of mine. We spent a lot of time in exploring the genre.
        However, for a period of years we stopped producing music, until 2004 when
        I returned to it. I have continued producing  tracks from then and until this
        very day, and nothing will ever stop me from make music again! In 2004 i started
        to produce \"Uplifiting Trance\" and \"Progressive Trance\", and it was at
        that time I spent some time in different countries and played my tracks in
        the clubbing scene. In the Year 2009 I tried to find a different form of expression,
        it the time i invented the \"Minimal Chill\" Style,  This style is a crossover
        between \"Minimal\" and \"Chillout \/ Trance\".
