        With the old specialists like Mike Oldfield and Jean Michel Jarre always on
        my mind, my main interest lies in electronic music. I always liked the the
        80''s where the synthie pop scene was invented, and it was also my very first
        time on the dance floor. At the end of the 80''s, I believe it was in ''86,
        a track called \"Electric Salsa\" from the artist Sven V\u00c3\u00a4th (the
        band name was \"OFF\") came out. In the year ''92 he founded the label EYE-Q
        Records which produced music with a sound that influenced me and got me in
        to the tekkno scene.  In the year 1995 i started to make electronic music
        along with a friend of mine. We spent a lot of time in exploring the genre.
        However, for a period of years we stopped producing music, until 2004 when
        I returned to it. I have continued producing  tracks from then and until this
        very day, and nothing will ever stop me from make music again! In 2004 i started
        to produce \"Uplifiting Trance\" and \"Progressive Trance\", and it was at
        that time I spent some time in different countries and played my tracks in
        the clubbing scene. In the Year 2009 I tried to find a different form of expression,
        it the time i invented the \"Minimal Chill\" Style,  This style is a crossover
        between \"Minimal\" and \"Chillout \/ Trance\".

        archipelago is beautiful - just like the \"Archipel\" of Oliver Schories.
        Various elements combined to a wonderful ensemble. Just as with ''Seenplatte''
        or ''Ostwind Limited Series'', Oliver sets crispy beats, soft strings and
        striking chords. Everything is in place and cut to the chase. A high area
        of the Azores which offers unequaled opportunities. Watch out, native fans
        of Bermuda shorts, \"Archipel\" will twist your bones with an about-face!
        A hymn which makes you spill your endorphin and which turns the summer into
        an unforgettable experience. On ''Flip'', Nils Nilson presents the perfect
        matching part. A descreet grooving dub piece, rolling down like a trade wind
        and turning into a giant warm monsoon after the break. A record made for the
        summer season. Sun, sand and the sea, what could be better? Many thanks go
        out to Oliver and Nils for this release.\r\n\r\nSupported by Stephan Bodzin,

        main direction while adding a note of profound serenity while being sweetly
        naive. Tool or not, tracks will work as music on its own but will also complement
